Taper models for spruce, pine and birch in Norway
and helper functions

The taper models are based on Hansen E., Rahlf J., Astrup R., Gobakken T. (2023) TAPER AND VOLUME MODELS FOR SPRUCE, PINE, AND BIRCH IN NORWAY (submitted).

## Abstract
Taper models, describing the shape of tree stems, are central in estimating stem volume. The Norwegian literature provides both taper- and volume models for the three main species, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. and B. pendula Roth). These models, however, were mainly developed using approaches established over 50 years ago, and without consistency between taper and volume. We selected and tested nine candidate models for taper and six candidate models for bark thickness, from previous studies outside of Norway. The models were fitted and evaluated using a large dataset covering all forested regions in Norway. The selected models were converted into volume functions using numerical integration providing both with- and without bark volumes, and compared to the volume functions in operational use in Norway. The models, with diameter at breast height and total tree height as input parameters, provide consistent volume estimates for spruce, pine, and birch. Additional parameters, tree age, site index, elevation, live crown proportion, and geographical region, were tested and included in the models but without any strong increase in predictive power.
