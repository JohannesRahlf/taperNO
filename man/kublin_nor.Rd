\title{Taper model for spruce, pine, and birch for Norway with dynamic diameter input}
\usage{
kublin_nor(Hx = NULL, Hm, Dm, mHt, sp = 1, Dx = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Hx}{height above ground where to return diameters (m)}

\item{Hm}{height above ground of measured diameters (m)}

\item{Dm}{measured diameters (cm)}

\item{mHt}{measured tree height (m) above ground}

\item{sp}{species}

\item{Dx}{or diameters (cm) for which to return a height}

\item{...}{parameters handed over to E_DHx_HmDm_HT.f or E_HDx_HmDm_HT.f}
}
\value{
When Hx is given: diameters at Hx (cm). When Dx is given: heights where d=Dx (m).
}
\description{
Based on Kublin et al. 2013. A flexible stem taper and volume prediction method based on mixed-effects B-spline regression. Eur J For Res. 132(5-6):983â€“997
and code in Kublin & Breidenbach (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TapeR).
}
\details{
Allows the use of multiple diameters measured at various points along the stem to estimate taper.
